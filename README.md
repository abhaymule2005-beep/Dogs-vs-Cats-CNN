# Dogs-vs-Cats-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model uses data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and is trained on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset. It demonstrates end-to-end deep learning workflow including data preprocessing.
